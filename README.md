# Test symmetries with sklearn decision tree models

### Setup
Begin from an environment with a recent version of python 3.

I recommend using anaconda:
```bash
conda create -n blank python==3.10.4
```
followed by
```bash
conda activate blank
```

Install and activate a python virtual environment with our required packages:
```bash
source setup.sh

```

Leave the environment with `deactivate`.
Clean up fully by removing `env/`.


### Run examples
```bash
make

```

### Independence is worth duplication (an excuse for this code structure)
